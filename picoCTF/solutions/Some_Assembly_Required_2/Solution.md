# Solution

The flag is in the same place as last time in Some_Assembly_Required_1, but
this time it is encoded. Put the string into cyberchef and run XOR with a key
of '8'. This was found using cyberchef's "Magic" operation and specifying
"pico" as a keyword. My flag had some junk characters inside the "picoCTF"
portion of the flag.
